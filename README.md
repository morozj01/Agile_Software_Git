I chose this article because I agree with its message and think that the existence of free and open source software has been one of the most important forces driving technological progress and economic growth. I don't think that people realize how much of the tech that they use and rely on a daily basis is built on top of open source solutions and I hope developers always continue to put out software accessible to everyone.

I liked this article because I am also a fan of the open source ideology, but while browsing the article I noticed specifically that the author called out the (I believe) harmful idea that open source automatically is associated with free software. I think it's often forgotten how much work these open source libraries take to make and developers are often not properly compensated for it, which is why you often see "Donate" links on websites for free or open source software. Long story short, pay for software!!
